# Static-website
During my first year at university, I undertook a project involving the creation of a static website using HTML and CSS. The project aimed to develop a website dedicated to a facet of computing and the internet, comprising three web pages focusing on significant individuals or technologies pivotal in computer and internet evolution. Each page featured a table providing historical insights like birth year, education, achievements, and more. Notably, the website included a navigational menu for seamless page transitions and incorporated CSS styling controlled by an external style sheet. The project was meticulously crafted without the use of code generators, ensuring compliance with guidelines. This endeavor earned a perfect score of 100%, showcasing my adeptness in HTML and CSS to craft visually appealing and functional websites.
